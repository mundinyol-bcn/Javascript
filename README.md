WELCOME TO BARCELONA!

We are a team of Asians and Spanish speakers of various nationalities, called Mundiñol. 

Since 2008 Mundiñol has been strengthening ties between Spain and Asian countries through Spanish, Catalan and Asian languages such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean and more.

We meet every week in Barcelona to practise Spanish, Catalan and other Asian and European languages.

We mainly focus on Spanish, Catalan, Japanese, and Chinese, but we also explore many other European and Asian languages together.

At Mundiñol, you'll find many people with a strong knowledge of linguistics, so it’s not just about casual conversation – you can also build a solid foundation in grammar.

Even if you don’t know any of the four main languages we focus on, as long as you’re keen to learn, you’ll have a fun and rewarding experience.

That’s what makes Mundiñol special – and why so many people have loved it since 2008!

At Mundiñol, you will have the opportunity to connect with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds, including professionals from Japan, China and Taiwan, as well as Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries.

The members specialize in various fields, such as IT, web development, culinary arts, professional hospitality, customer service, sales, etc.
